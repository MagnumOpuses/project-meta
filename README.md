# Project meta

Project meta contains documentation and tools (future) for creating and maintaining JobTech open source projects.
Jobtechdev.se is the common window where projects created in the spirit of JobTech are visualized.  
A JobTech project, not shown on jobtechdev.se, is no JobTech project.

To be called a JobTech project there are a few obligations
* The project should have connection to the Swedish labour market
* The project has to be Open Source
* The project will be found at Github
* The project uses the listed .md files

If the project follow these lines, you could get it published at jobtechdev.se  
Send an email to <contact@jobtechdev.se>
